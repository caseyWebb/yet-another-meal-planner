## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Admin panel is organized into top-level areas with client-side routing

The admin SPA SHALL organize its surfaces into top-level areas — a **Status** area (the operator-facing background-job health view), a **Members** area (member management), a **Dev** area (the tool console and future developer surfaces), and a **Data** area (the read-only data explorer over D1 and the R2 corpus) — navigable by client-side routing so each surface has its own URL and a new surface is added as its own routed module rather than another card on a single page. The panel's **home** route (`/admin`) SHALL be the Status view; member management SHALL be reached at its own route (`/admin/members`), and the data explorer at its own routes under `/admin/data/*`, not at the panel root. Navigating between surfaces SHALL update the browser URL, and a deep link or refresh to a surface's URL SHALL load that surface directly.

#### Scenario: Navigation updates the URL

- **WHEN** the operator switches from one area to another (e.g. from Status to member management, the tool console, or the data explorer)
- **THEN** the browser URL changes to that surface's route and the surface renders, without a full-page server reload

#### Scenario: Home route shows the Status view

- **WHEN** the operator opens `/admin` (or `/`)
- **THEN** the Status (background-job health) view renders as the home surface, not member management

#### Scenario: Member management has its own route

- **WHEN** the operator opens `/admin/members` directly (or refreshes there)
- **THEN** the Worker serves the SPA shell and the app routes to the member-management surface

#### Scenario: Deep link to a tool

- **WHEN** the operator opens `/admin/dev/tools/<tool>` directly (or refreshes there)
- **THEN** the Worker serves the SPA shell and the app routes to that tool's view

#### Scenario: Deep link to a data view

- **WHEN** the operator opens a data-explorer route such as `/admin/data/recipes/<slug>` directly (or refreshes there)
- **THEN** the Worker serves the SPA shell and the app routes to that data view
