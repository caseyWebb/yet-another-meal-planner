## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Required recipe body sections

The system SHALL fail the build (non-zero exit) when a recipe body does not contain both an `## Ingredients` H2 section and an `## Instructions` H2 section. Additional H2 sections (e.g. `## Notes`) SHALL be permitted and SHALL NOT cause failure. This guarantees the structural contract that downstream site generation relies on to locate the ingredient and step lists.

#### Scenario: Missing Ingredients section blocks the build

- **WHEN** a recipe body omits the `## Ingredients` section
- **THEN** the build exits non-zero and reports the offending file and missing section

#### Scenario: Missing Instructions section blocks the build

- **WHEN** a recipe body omits the `## Instructions` section
- **THEN** the build exits non-zero and reports the offending file and missing section

#### Scenario: Extra sections are allowed

- **WHEN** a recipe body contains `## Ingredients`, `## Instructions`, and an additional `## Notes` section
- **THEN** validation passes for that recipe
