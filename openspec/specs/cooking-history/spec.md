# cooking-history Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change cooking-log-and-retrospection. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Durable cooking log, not an eating log

The system SHALL maintain the per-tenant cooking log as rows in the D1 `cooking_log` table (`tenant`, `date`, `type`, `recipe`, `name`, `protein`, `cuisine`, `meal`) — a durable, append-only record of **cooking events and at-home convenience meals**, not everything eaten. Each row SHALL carry a `date` (ISO date, required) and a `type` (required, one of `recipe`, `ready_to_eat`, `ad_hoc`), and MAY carry a **`meal`** — a nullable closed-set value `breakfast | lunch | dinner | project`, where NULL means "unknown / not a meal" (stories/02 Q2: there is no fourth "other" enum value — `type` and `meal` are orthogonal axes; a baked loaf logs `{ type: 'ad_hoc', meal: null }`). Rows that predate the meal dimension keep `meal` NULL — the migration never fabricates a meal. A row with `type = recipe` SHALL carry a `recipe` slug (a soft reference to `recipes.slug`, no foreign-key constraint — history survives a recipe's removal) and SHALL NOT duplicate the recipe's protein/cuisine inline (those are looked up from the `recipes` table at read time). A row with `type = ready_to_eat` or `ad_hoc` SHALL carry a `name` and MAY carry inline `protein` / `cuisine` dimensions so it still contributes to mix aggregates. The system SHALL NOT log eating out, and SHALL NOT re-log leftovers of an already-logged cook (one cook that feeds multiple meals is one entry). The log SHALL NOT contain planned-but-not-yet-cooked meals; planned intent lives in the D1 `meal_plan` table.

#### Scenario: Recipe cook appends a slug row with its meal

- **WHEN** the user asserts they cooked a corpus recipe for dinner
- **THEN** a `cooking_log` row with `date`, `type = recipe`, the `recipe` slug, and `meal = 'dinner'` is inserted for the caller, with no inline protein/cuisine

#### Scenario: Pre-existing rows stay meal-unknown (F4)

- **WHEN** the meal-dimension migration runs over the production log (four `type = 'recipe'` rows)
- **THEN** all four rows carry `meal` NULL — nothing is fabricated — and they still count in overall cadence while reporting under `meal_unknown`

#### Scenario: A non-meal event logs with a null meal

- **WHEN** the user logs baking a loaf of bread
- **THEN** a `type = ad_hoc` entry with `meal` NULL is appended — no fourth "other" meal value exists

#### Scenario: Eating out is not logged

- **WHEN** the user mentions eating at a restaurant
- **THEN** no `cooking_log` row is appended

#### Scenario: Ready-to-eat consumption decrements pantry and records a favorite

- **WHEN** the user says they ate a ready-to-eat item (e.g. "I had the frozen lasagna")
- **THEN** a `type = ready_to_eat` row is inserted and that item's on-hand stock in the D1 `pantry` table is decremented, and the row contributes to the item's favored-frequency signal

### Requirement: `last_cooked` is derived from the log

The system SHALL treat a recipe's `last_cooked` as a value **derived by query**, equal to `MAX(date)` over the caller's `cooking_log` rows where `type = recipe` and `recipe` equals that slug — never stored on the recipe (the `recipes` table holds no per-tenant `last_cooked`). It is realized automatically when a cooked row for that recipe is appended; there is no separate write. `last_cooked` SHALL NOT be affected at plan/menu-agreement time.

#### Scenario: last_cooked is a query, not a stored field

- **WHEN** `search_recipes` or `read_recipe` resolves a recipe's `last_cooked`
- **THEN** the value comes from `MAX(date)` over the caller's `cooking_log` recipe rows for that slug, with no `last_cooked` written to the recipe

#### Scenario: Cooking a recipe updates its derived last_cooked

- **WHEN** a `type = recipe` row is appended for `arroz-caldo` dated 2026-06-09
- **THEN** `arroz-caldo`'s derived `last_cooked` for the caller becomes 2026-06-09 by query, with nothing written to the recipe

#### Scenario: Planning does not move last_cooked

- **WHEN** a recipe is added to the plan but not yet cooked
- **THEN** its derived `last_cooked` is unchanged

### Requirement: Cook-capture appends to D1 via log_cooked

The system SHALL provide a cook-capture path via the `log_cooked` tool, which appends one cooking event to the caller's `cooking_log` table and returns without a `commit_sha`. It SHALL accept an optional **`meal`** (`breakfast | lunch | dinner | project`; omitted stores NULL, valid on all `type`s — cooking a planned project logs `{ type: 'recipe', meal: 'project' }`) and an optional **`plan_row_id`** addressing the exact plan row to clear. It SHALL validate the entry at write time (an ISO `date` defaulting to today; a `type` in {`recipe`, `ready_to_eat`, `ad_hoc`}; a `recipe` entry's slug resolved against the D1 `recipes` table; a non-recipe entry requires `name`) — an unresolved slug is a structured `not_found` error written nowhere, and a missing required field is a `validation_failed` error. For a `recipe` entry it SHALL clear **at most one** matching `meal_plan` row per the deterministic clear order (the dedicated requirement below), in the **same D1 transaction** as the cooking-log insert, returning `cleared_plan_row?: { id, recipe, meal, planned_for }` additively. Route-level idempotent dedupe identity SHALL be **per-`(date, meal, type, recipe|name)`**, where a NULL `meal` matches NULL only — this is cooking_log **dedupe identity only, never plan-row identity**. Any pantry decrements the user confirms are applied via `update_pantry`. The build SHALL NOT validate the cooking log (it is no longer in GitHub). The agent SHALL NOT claim a meal was logged that the user did not assert.

#### Scenario: Recipe entry with a real slug is logged and clears one row atomically

- **WHEN** `log_cooked({ type: "recipe", recipe: "miso-salmon", meal: "dinner" })` is called and `miso-salmon` exists in `recipes` with one planned row
- **THEN** a `cooking_log` row is inserted for the caller dated today with `meal = 'dinner'`, exactly that plan row is deleted in the same D1 transaction, and the result carries `cleared_plan_row` with the row's id

#### Scenario: Recipe entry with an unknown slug is rejected

- **WHEN** `log_cooked({ type: "recipe", recipe: "not-a-recipe" })` is called and no such slug exists
- **THEN** a structured `not_found` error is returned and nothing is written

#### Scenario: Unplanned cook still logs

- **WHEN** the user asserts cooking something that was not on the meal plan
- **THEN** a `cooking_log` row is inserted without requiring a prior plan row, and no plan row is cleared

#### Scenario: The dedupe identity includes the meal

- **WHEN** the same recipe is logged twice on one date, once with `meal: "lunch"` and once with `meal: "dinner"`
- **THEN** both rows exist (different dedupe identities), while a replay of either exact `(date, meal, type, recipe)` tuple is deduplicated — and this identity is never used as plan-row identity

### Requirement: Retrospective over real cooking history

The system SHALL provide a `retrospective(period)` tool that aggregates the caller's `cooking_log` rows over the requested period, resolving each `type = recipe` row's protein/cuisine from the D1 `recipes` table (a `cooking_log LEFT JOIN recipes`) and each non-recipe row's dimensions from its inline columns. It SHALL return `recipes_cooked` (cooks in the window), `protein_mix` and `cuisine_mix` (counts by dimension over the window, including inline dimensions from non-recipe rows; rows lacking a dimension bucket under `unknown`), a **meal-aware cadence** measure — the overall `cooks_per_week` (definition unchanged: cooks per week over the period, counting `recipe` + `ad_hoc` only — `ready_to_eat` is not cooking), plus **`by_meal: { breakfast, lunch, dinner, project }`** over rows whose `meal` is set and **`meal_unknown: N`** counting NULL-meal rows (pre-migration rows are counted in the overall figure, reported unknown, never fabricated) — a **cook-vs-convenience** breakdown (cooked = `recipe` + `ad_hoc` vs convenience = `ready_to_eat`), **`ready_to_eat_favorites`** (ready-to-eat names frequency-ranked over the period), and **`underused`** with its companion **`underused_count`** (defined below). An empty log SHALL return an empty result with no error.

The `period` argument SHALL scope only `recipes_cooked`, `protein_mix`, `cuisine_mix`, cadence (including `by_meal` and `meal_unknown`), cook-vs-convenience, and `ready_to_eat_favorites`. `underused` SHALL be **independent of `period`** and SHALL surface **loved recipes that have gone quiet and are in season** — not "every recipe not cooked in the window." A recipe SHALL qualify as `underused` WHEN all of the following hold:

- **loved** — the caller has favorited it (declared preference), OR has cooked it (`type = recipe`) **at least 3 times within the trailing 12 months** ending at `now` (revealed preference);
- **stale** — its derived `last_cooked` is `null` (never cooked) or strictly older than a **fixed 30-day** window ending at `now`;
- **in season** — its `season` is empty (year-round) or includes the **current season**, derived from `now` (Northern-hemisphere meteorological months);
- **not rejected** — a recipe the caller has rejected SHALL NOT appear, even when it is otherwise loved and stale.

Each `underused` item SHALL carry `slug`, `title`, `last_cooked`, `why` (`"favorite"` when the caller favorited the recipe, otherwise `"revealed"`), and `cook_count` (the caller's **all-time** `type = recipe` count for that slug). `underused` SHALL be ordered stalest-first (never-cooked before any cooked, then ascending `last_cooked`, then `slug`) and SHALL be **capped at the 15 stalest items**. `underused_count` SHALL report the total number of qualifying recipes before the cap, so the caller can tell how many were elided.

#### Scenario: Protein mix reflects every cook, not just the latest

- **WHEN** a protein is cooked multiple times in the period
- **THEN** `protein_mix` counts each cook event, not one row per recipe

#### Scenario: Cadence reports per-meal counts and the unknown bucket (F4)

- **WHEN** `retrospective` runs over a log holding two dinner-mealed rows, one lunch-mealed row, and four pre-migration NULL-meal rows
- **THEN** the cadence section reports the overall `cooks_per_week` over all seven, `by_meal` with `dinner: 2` and `lunch: 1`, and `meal_unknown: 4` — no meal is fabricated for the NULL rows

#### Scenario: retrospective joins the recipe index

- **WHEN** `retrospective` runs for a window
- **THEN** it queries the caller's `cooking_log` rows joined to `recipes`, using each recipe row's recipe-derived protein/cuisine and each non-recipe row's inline dimensions

#### Scenario: Empty log is valid

- **WHEN** the caller has no `cooking_log` rows
- **THEN** `retrospective` returns an empty result (including an empty `underused` and `underused_count: 0`) with no error

#### Scenario: Cadence counts cooking, not convenience

- **WHEN** the period contains both `recipe`/`ad_hoc` and `ready_to_eat` entries
- **THEN** cadence counts only the `recipe` and `ad_hoc` entries, while cook-vs-convenience reports both sides

#### Scenario: Ready-to-eat favorites are frequency-ranked

- **WHEN** the period contains repeated `ready_to_eat` entries for the same item
- **THEN** `ready_to_eat_favorites` ranks that item by how often it appears

#### Scenario: A stale favorite is underused

- **WHEN** the caller has favorited a recipe whose derived `last_cooked` is older than 30 days and whose season includes the current season
- **THEN** it appears in `underused` with `why: "favorite"`

#### Scenario: A favorited-but-never-cooked recipe is underused

- **WHEN** the caller has favorited an in-season recipe they have never cooked (`last_cooked` is `null`)
- **THEN** it appears in `underused` with `why: "favorite"` and sorts ahead of every cooked entry

#### Scenario: A revealed favorite that has gone quiet is underused

- **WHEN** the caller has never favorited an in-season recipe but has cooked it at least 3 times in the trailing 12 months and not within the last 30 days
- **THEN** it appears in `underused` with `why: "revealed"` and `cook_count` equal to its all-time cook count

#### Scenario: A one-off cook is not underused

- **WHEN** an in-season recipe the caller has not favorited was cooked only once in the trailing 12 months and is stale
- **THEN** it does NOT appear in `underused` (a single cook is not revealed preference)

#### Scenario: A rejected recipe is excluded even when loved and stale

- **WHEN** an in-season recipe the caller cooked many times was later rejected
- **THEN** it does NOT appear in `underused`

#### Scenario: An out-of-season loved recipe is excluded

- **WHEN** the caller has favorited a stale recipe whose `season` is `["winter"]` and the current season is `summer`
- **THEN** it does NOT appear in `underused`; a favorited stale recipe with `season: []` under the same conditions DOES appear

#### Scenario: Underused ignores the period and uses a fixed 30-day window

- **WHEN** `retrospective("year")` runs and the caller has favorited a recipe cooked 20 days ago
- **THEN** that recipe is NOT `underused` (cooked within the fixed 30-day staleness window), regardless of the year-long `period`

#### Scenario: Underused is capped with a total count

- **WHEN** more than 15 loved, stale, in-season recipes qualify
- **THEN** `underused` returns the 15 stalest items and `underused_count` reports the full qualifying total

### Requirement: Ready-to-eat acquisition is cross-recorded at inventory capture

Ready-to-eat consumption decrements on-hand stock in the D1 `pantry` table (the caller's ready-to-eat catalog is options-only), so the on-hand view is only correct if acquisition records the same stock. Whenever the agent records physical inventory **outside onboarding** — notably the standalone `update_pantry` flow (e.g. a freezer haul of frozen dinners) — and the items named are heat-and-eat items, the agent SHALL record their on-hand stock via `update_pantry` AND SHALL **offer** to add them to the caller's ready-to-eat catalog via `add_draft_ready_to_eat` (`status: active`) when they are not already cataloged, using a consistent `name` so the favorites↔pantry-on-hand restock cross-reference matches. It SHALL offer rather than silently catalog (consistent with the persona's don't-auto-add stance) and SHALL require no new MCP tool. (The onboarding capture points are covered by the guided-onboarding capability.)

#### Scenario: Ad-hoc freezer haul of heat-and-eat items is offered for cataloging

- **WHEN** the member says they just stocked the freezer with several frozen dinners via the pantry-update flow
- **THEN** the agent records them as pantry on-hand stock via `update_pantry` and offers to add the ones not already in the catalog via `add_draft_ready_to_eat`, under the same name used in the pantry

#### Scenario: Already-cataloged item only updates stock

- **WHEN** a heat-and-eat item the member restocks is already an `active` entry in their ready-to-eat catalog
- **THEN** the agent records the on-hand stock via `update_pantry` and does not re-add a duplicate catalog entry

### Requirement: Vibe satisfaction provenance on cooks

When `log_cooked` logs a `type = recipe` cook, it SHALL attribute vibe satisfaction by a **cook-time cosine match** of the cooked recipe against the caller's meal-vibe palette, writing a satisfaction record for each matched vibe **in the same D1 transaction** as the cooking-log insert (and, for an on-plan cook, the meal-plan clear). Attribution SHALL union: (a) **the cleared row's `from_vibe`** — read from the row the deterministic clear order actually cleared (never a slug-global lookup), when present — as a **guaranteed-reset prior** that always gets a record, even at a borderline cosine; and (b) every palette vibe whose embedding the cooked recipe's embedding matches at or above a calibrated cosine threshold. The cosine candidates SHALL be **meal-scoped**: when the entry carries a `meal`, only vibes whose `meal` equals it are candidates; a NULL-meal entry matches against all vibes (fail-open, the pre-meal behavior); the `from_vibe` prior always resets regardless of meal. A cook MAY therefore satisfy **more than one** vibe, and an **off-plan** cook (no cleared row, or a cleared row without `from_vibe`) SHALL still record satisfaction for every vibe it genuinely matches — off-plan cooks are not null-attributed. To bound over-reset, the top match SHALL record a full reset and lower matches SHALL be gated by the threshold, so one recipe cannot suppress the whole palette. A meal vibe's `last_satisfied` SHALL be derived by query as `MAX(date)` over the caller's satisfaction records for that vibe — never stored on the vibe. The cosine match SHALL reuse the ranking machinery (`rankCandidates` / the `recipe_derived` and `night_vibe_derived` embeddings); it SHALL NOT introduce a new AI call — both embeddings are cron-captured. This is additive to existing `log_cooked` behavior: the insert, the atomic clear, slug resolution, and validation are unchanged.

#### Scenario: An on-plan cook records its aimed vibe plus any it also matches

- **WHEN** a planned row carrying `from_vibe` is cleared by a logged cook, and the recipe also cosine-matches a second palette vibe of the entry's meal at/above the threshold
- **THEN** the transaction inserts satisfaction records for both the cleared row's `from_vibe` (guaranteed) and the second vibe, alongside the cooking-log insert and plan-clear

#### Scenario: Attribution reads provenance from the cleared row only

- **WHEN** a recipe occupies two plan rows with different `from_vibe` values and one cook clears the earliest-due row
- **THEN** only the cleared row's `from_vibe` receives the guaranteed reset — the other row's provenance is untouched for its own future cook

#### Scenario: An off-plan cook records the matched vibes of its meal

- **WHEN** an off-plan meal is logged with `meal: "dinner"` whose recipe cosine-matches a dinner vibe and a lunch vibe at/above the threshold
- **THEN** a satisfaction record is written for the dinner vibe only — meal-scoping bounds the candidates — and a NULL-meal entry would have matched both

#### Scenario: Over-reset is bounded

- **WHEN** a cooked recipe matches three palette vibes, one strongly and two weakly near the threshold
- **THEN** the top match records a full reset and the weaker matches are admitted only if they clear the gate, so a single dish does not reset the whole palette

#### Scenario: No new AI call at cook time

- **WHEN** `log_cooked` computes the cosine attribution
- **THEN** it reuses the cron-captured `recipe_derived` and `night_vibe_derived` embeddings via the existing ranking machinery and issues no new embedding call

### Requirement: Member log corrections

The system SHALL provide a bounded, most-recent-first read of the caller's `cooking_log`
(ordered by `date` then insertion id, recipe entries enriched with the recipe's title and
facets from the shared index) and a tenant-scoped delete of a single log entry by its row id,
serving the member web surface's cooking-log page. The delete SHALL remove only a row owned by
the calling tenant; everything derived from the log (`last_cooked`, the retrospective, vibe
cadence recency) SHALL reflect the deletion organically on the next read, since none of it is
materialized. These are operations behind the member `/api` surface; no new MCP tool is added —
the agent-side contract (`log_cooked` append + `retrospective`) is unchanged.

#### Scenario: The log page lists the caller's history

- **WHEN** the member log read is called
- **THEN** it returns the caller's entries most-recent-first, bounded, with recipe entries
  carrying the recipe's title and facets, and each row carrying its id

#### Scenario: Deleting a mis-log heals derived reads

- **WHEN** a member deletes a mistakenly logged cook by id
- **THEN** only that tenant-owned row is removed, and a subsequent `last_cooked` or
  retrospective read no longer reflects it

#### Scenario: A member cannot delete another tenant's entry

- **WHEN** a delete is attempted with an id belonging to a different tenant
- **THEN** nothing is deleted and the result reports the entry as not found

### Requirement: Deterministic plan-row clear order

For a `type = recipe` entry, `log_cooked` SHALL resolve which plan row to clear by this deterministic order (D26-final), clearing **at most ONE row** — an explicit "add again" duplicate survives the first cook, which is the point of duplication:

1. **`plan_row_id` supplied**: the row exists and its recipe slug-matches the entry → clear exactly that row. The row exists but the recipe mismatches → structured `conflict`, **no log written** (never clear a different dish's slot). The row is **absent** → **no clear, the log is still written**, and the result notes the stale id (`cleared_plan_row: null` plus a note) — deliberately **no fall-through** to the slug stages: on replay the row was already cleared and the intent satisfied; falling through would consume an unrelated explicit duplicate.
2. Else **exact `(recipe, meal, date)`** (requires the entry to carry both `meal` and `date`): slug match ∧ row `meal` = entry meal ∧ row `planned_for` = entry date; ties among explicit duplicates break by the earliest-due selector (`planned_for ASC NULLS LAST, id ASC`).
3. Else the **earliest-due row for the slug**, **excluding `meal='project'` rows unless the entry's `meal` is `'project'`** — cooking a dinner never silently consumes a same-slug project row.
4. No match → no clear (an off-plan cook, as today).

#### Scenario: A stale plan_row_id logs without clearing and without fall-through

- **WHEN** `log_cooked` is replayed with a `plan_row_id` whose row was already cleared, while another explicit-duplicate row for the same slug still exists
- **THEN** the log row is written, no plan row is cleared (the surviving duplicate is untouched), and the result carries `cleared_plan_row: null` with a note about the stale id

#### Scenario: An exact (recipe, meal, date) match clears that slot

- **WHEN** a recipe is planned twice — Tuesday lunch and Thursday dinner — and the user logs it with `meal: "lunch"`, `date` = Tuesday
- **THEN** exactly the Tuesday-lunch row is cleared and the Thursday dinner survives

#### Scenario: The earliest-due fallback never consumes a project row

- **WHEN** a slug has an undated dinner row and a `meal='project'` row, and `log_cooked` runs with no `plan_row_id` and no exact match
- **THEN** the dinner row is cleared and the project row survives; only an entry with `meal: "project"` may clear the project row

#### Scenario: One cook clears one row

- **WHEN** a recipe occupies two explicitly-duplicated dinner slots and the user logs one cook
- **THEN** exactly one row (the earliest-due) is cleared and the duplicate remains planned
