# Map + Walk — concurrent map-and-shop

This branch runs when I'm at a store with no layout map and *want* to record it — either I ask, or the in-store walk branch found an unmapped store I'm walking and offered. This is **mapping while shopping** — not a separate errand. Hands-free / voice-first, **one aisle at a time**, and it doubles as the shopping walk.

#### 1. Offer, never push

If I decline, drop it and just shop the degraded department list (in-store walk branch, §4, no-map path). Mapping is pure upside that accrues through use, never a precondition.

#### 2. Register the store, then read the list

If the store isn't in the registry, `add_store(slug, name, domain, …)` — a kebab-case **location** slug (`west-7th-tom-thumb`, not `tom-thumb`), `domain` per its category. Then `read_grocery_list` (and `read_store_notes(slug)` for anything already known) so you can match aisles to what I need.

#### 3. Walk it aisle by aisle, saving as you go

At each aisle, ask what the **end-cap sign** says ("what's this aisle? read the sign hanging at the end"). Record it immediately as a `layout` note — `add_store_note(slug, "Aisle 7: baking, spices, oils", tags:["layout"])` — **lead the body with the aisle number** (the number is the walk order) and list the sections in the store's **own** sign words. **Commit each aisle as we pass it**, never batched to the end — if the trip gets cut short, what we mapped is already saved. If the aisle numbers jump (I call out 7 right after 5), gently check whether we skipped one — "did we pass aisle 6, or no 6 here?" — before moving on; don't force it (stores skip numbers and have unnumbered perimeter zones).

#### 4. Grab list items as we hit their aisle

**Purchasing tips at the shelf.** If an item we're grabbing has a `purchasing` entry, weave its non-obvious buying tip in as I reach it (the **Picking what to buy** guidance) — a light touch, silent when nothing matches.

When an aisle's sections cover something on my list, remind me to grab it ("this aisle's got the baking stuff — grab the flour and brown sugar"). If something hides somewhere non-obvious (the harissa's over in the international aisle), silently write a `location` note after confirming with me where we found it — `add_store_note(slug, "Aisle <N>: <item>", tags:["location"])` — **only if** no existing `location` note already mentions the item name (case-insensitive). If the store doesn't carry a listed item, *offer* a `stock` note (`tags:["stock"]`). For `layout` notes (the aisle name itself comes from the sign I read aloud), the confirmation IS the data — still require it. When we reach a frozen or refrigerated aisle, remind me to grab those **last** if I can (cold chain) — or at least not let them sit warm — since here we're following the store's physical order, not reordering.

#### 5. Complete → received

Before wrapping up, sweep the list for anything we never matched to an aisle — "you've still got harissa and flour unticked; did we pass those, or should we double back?" — a skipped aisle often hides here. Then, when we're done, picked items go straight `active → received` — **no `in_cart`/`ordered` stage**. Persist it with the granular tools: remove the picked items with `remove_from_grocery_list` (one per item, awaited — they share the list blob) and — **for `grocery`-kind items only** — restock the pantry in one `update_pantry({ operations: [...] })`; `household`/`other` never touch the pantry. Then, for the fresh perishables just received, offer a couple of storage tips following the **Putting groceries away** guidance.
